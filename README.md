## C. Augusto Casas ðŸ‘‹


As a dedicated professor of cybersecurity with over 20 years of teaching experience, my core philosophy revolves around fostering a learning environment where students are the central focus. My commitment to education is reflected in my approach to course design, where I employ backward design principles to ensure that learning objectives are met effectively. I meticulously craft courses that adhere to the Quality Matters Rubric and prioritize accessibility, ensuring that all students have equal opportunities to succeed regardless of their learning needs.

My goal is to empower students with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. By integrating real-world scenarios and hands-on experiences into my curriculum, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. True learning occurs when students are engaged, challenged, and supported throughout their educational journey.

I am proud to have contributed to the growth and success of countless information systems professionals. As I continue to evolve as an educator, my focus remains steadfast on enhancing student learning outcomes and preparing the next generation of cybersecurity experts to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.
